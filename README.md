# Information Retrieval and Text Matching

This repository contains an implementation of information retrieval and text-matching techniques using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The project explores methodologies to extract relevant information from textual data and perform text similarity matching for various use cases.

## Overview
This project addresses the challenges in retrieving relevant information from textual datasets and measuring the semantic similarity between text segments. With the increasing volume of unstructured text data, effective information retrieval and text-matching techniques are essential for applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, and document classification.

Key highlights of this project include:
- Preprocessing textual data using tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization.
- Implementing similarity measures such as cosine similarity.
- Exploring embedding techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings for enhanced text representation.
- Demonstrating applications of text matching in query-document retrieval and duplicate text detection.

This project serves as a foundation for understanding the principles of text processing and retrieval, with practical examples to illustrate its applications.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Includes steps like tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization for structured text representation.
- **Similarity Metrics:** Implements cosine similarity, Jaccard index, and other measures for text comparison.
- **Embedding Techniques:** Utilizes TF-IDF and word embeddings for capturing semantic relationships.
- **Practical Use Cases:** Demonstrates query-document matching and duplicate text detection scenarios.

## Dataset
The project works with both custom and publicly available textual datasets. Ensure the dataset is formatted appropriately for preprocessing and analysis. Example datasets for testing can be downloaded from sources like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Results
The project demonstrates the successful implementation of:
- Text preprocessing pipelines.
- Similarity measurement using various metrics.
- Improved text-matching performance with advanced embeddings.

Detailed visualizations and evaluation metrics are included in the notebook.

## Acknowledgments
- This project was done during my masters degree at the University of Adelaide which was included in coursework.
