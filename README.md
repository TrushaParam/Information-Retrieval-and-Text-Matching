This project focused on developing an application to retrieve and match relevant scientific articles based on a given query.

The information retrieval and text-matching system successfully identified and retrieved relevant scientific articles based on user queries. The project demonstrated the effectiveness of combining various NLP techniques for accurate information retrieval. It also highlighted the importance of text pre-processing and query matching in developing robust retrieval systems.

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in applying NLP concepts and algorithms to real-world problems. By leveraging existing NLP tools and techniques, I developed an effective information retrieval system. The project also laid the groundwork for more advanced applications, such as a question-answering system, by demonstrating how to decompose complex NLP problems into manageable sub-problems
