This project focused on developing an application to retrieve and match relevant scientific articles based on a given query. The assignment provided practical experience in applying information retrieval and text matching techniques, supporting several key Course Learning Outcomes.
Objectives
Apply NLP Concepts and Algorithms:

Utilized foundational concepts and algorithms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to address real-world information retrieval problems.
Implement NLP Methods:

Leveraged existing NLP tools to perform tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and text summarization.
Decompose Real-world Problems:

Analyzed complex NLP problems and decomposed them into sub-problems to identify potential solutions.
Results and Insights
The information retrieval and text matching system successfully identified and retrieved relevant scientific articles based on user queries. The project demonstrated the effectiveness of combining various NLP techniques for accurate information retrieval. It also highlighted the importance of text pre-processing and query matching in developing robust retrieval systems.

Conclusion
This project provided valuable hands-on experience in applying NLP concepts and algorithms to real-world problems. By leveraging existing NLP tools and techniques, I developed an effective information retrieval system. The project also laid the groundwork for more advanced applications, such as a question answering system, by demonstrating how to decompose complex NLP problems into manageable sub-problems
